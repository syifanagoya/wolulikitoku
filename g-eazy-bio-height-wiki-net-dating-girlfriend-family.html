Girlfriend, Family</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>From time to time, it will be necessary to look back on all of Indy’s accomplishments in the music industry.&nbsp;Whenever this happens, G-Eazy will always top the list.&nbsp;This California-based rapper is the definition of a self-taught musician.</span></p><p><span>His skills behind the mic have earned him envious spots on the Billboard charts, and collaborations with established artists in and out of his genre.&nbsp;A serial lyricist, G-Eazy memorably recorded three albums in four years, between 2014 and 2017.&nbsp;</span><span>Me, me and me</span><span>&nbsp;the rapper and record producer is just getting started.</span></p><h2><strong><span>G-Eazy Biography, Family</span></strong></h2><p><span>G-Eazy was born Gerard Earl Gillum on May 24, 1989.&nbsp;He has a younger brother, James, who plays the trumpet.&nbsp;His mother, Suzanne, and his father, an art teacher, Eduard Gillum, separated when young Gillum was in first grade.&nbsp;His mother had started dating a woman named Melissa Mills at the time, which puzzled Gillum.&nbsp;He eventually had to live with his grandparents in Berkeley, California, where he continued his education.&nbsp;They would later move to North Oakland.&nbsp;Gillum, however, continued his education at Berkeley.</span></p><p><span>From 2008 to 2013, G-Eazy went from a struggling aspiring student artist to one of the biggest names to watch in the New HipHop era.</span></p><p><span>Gillum attended Loyola University in New Orleans.&nbsp;It was there that he met his producer, Christopher Andersson, who was also signed up there.&nbsp;In his early days, he was a member of the collaboration group “The Bad Boyz”, which had posted many of their original songs on their Myspace page.&nbsp;This and many other events led him to become a recognized talent in the East Bay area.&nbsp;His biggest success at the time came when he was to open for artists such as Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg in 2010.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy’s mixtapes in 2009 and 2011 didn’t fare as well, or at least not as well as he hoped.&nbsp;Her 2011 project,&nbsp;</span><span>Endless Summer</span><span>&nbsp;featured a number of songs.&nbsp;The most successful song on the mixtape is the remix of Dion Mucci’s 1961 hit&nbsp;</span><span>Runaround Sue.&nbsp;</span><span>The music video garnered over four million YouTube views.&nbsp;He worked on the project with other notables such as Erika Flowers, Greg Banks and Devon Baldwin.&nbsp;He toured the album nationally with Shwayze in November 2011.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy was also ubiquitous on the 2012 Vans Warped Tour, where he performed on all US dates.&nbsp;A month later, he was involved with Hoodie on the Excellent&nbsp;USA Cities&nbsp;</span><span>Adventure Tour</span></p><p><span>In September 2012, Gillum released&nbsp;</span><span>Must Be Kind,</span><span>&nbsp;his first full-length, for-profit, completely independent label album.&nbsp;The album’s reception was the opposite of its mixtape days.&nbsp;It was #3 on the iTunes Hip-Hop chart.&nbsp;This success obviously has to do with Lil Wayne’s callback to reopen&nbsp;</span><span>on America’s Most Wanted Tour</span><span>&nbsp;in 2013.</span></p><p><span>His next album&nbsp;</span><span>These Things Happen</span><span>&nbsp;was his first studio album under a major label,&nbsp;</span><span>RCA Records.&nbsp;</span><span>The album was released on June 23, 2014 in the US and a month later in the UK.&nbsp;This one also landed at No. 3 on the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;200 and the Top Digital Albums chart.&nbsp;After its release, it embarked on a 40-date tour of the United States and Canada.&nbsp;He was accompanied by fellow artists Rocky Fresh, Tory Lanez and KYLE.&nbsp;In October 2015, the album was certified gold by the RIAA.</span></p><p><span>His next tour started on October 21, 2014. The sold-out tour was titled&nbsp;</span><span>From the Bay to the Universe</span><span>&nbsp;and included dates in countries including New Zealand and Australia.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy has performed at notable music festivals such as&nbsp;</span><span>Electric Forest, Outer Lands, Lollapalooza,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Made in America.&nbsp;</span><span>the rapper is also a fashionaficionado, and in the fall of 2015 teamed up with Rare Panther to launch a line of fashion items.&nbsp;Her efforts in this regard and her sense of style earned her a GQ Magazine “Top 10 Stylists” listing&nbsp;</span><span>at New York Fashion Week.</span></p><p><span>His second studio album&nbsp;</span><span>When It’s Dark</span><span>&nbsp;was released on December 4, 2015. The album’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Me, Myself and Me</span><span>, reached #7 on the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;100. It featured singer Bebe Rexha on the track.&nbsp;The album’s tour began in January 2016 and included venues in the United States, Europe and Australia.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, he was also featured on Britney Spear’s song&nbsp;</span><span>Do Me</span><span>&nbsp;her ninth studio album.&nbsp;The duo performed the song onstage at the&nbsp;</span><span>2016 MTV Video Music Awards</span><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><span>iHeartRadio Music Festival</span><span>&nbsp;in the same year.</span></p><p><span>Gillum was nominated for&nbsp;</span><span>Best Hip-Hop Artist</span><span>&nbsp;at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2016. He was also nominated for a People’s Choice Award in the&nbsp;</span><span>Favorite HipHop Artist</span><span>&nbsp;category in 2017. He won the latter.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy released a sequel to&nbsp;</span><span>Endless Summer</span><span>&nbsp;mixtape titled&nbsp;</span><span>Endless Summer II</span><span>&nbsp;and his third studio album titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Beautiful and the Damned</span><span>&nbsp;on December 15, 2017&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>G-Eazy Height, Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>This entertainer is a tall dude, standing at an intimidating height of 1.92m (6ft 4in).&nbsp;G-Eazy’s numerous albums, tours and feature films have earned him a net worth of $9 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>dating, girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>At various points in his career, G-Eazy has been rumored to date Lana del Ray and then Britney Spears.&nbsp;As early as 2011, he would also have started a relationship with singer Devon Baldwin.&nbsp;It was reported that they clicked while working on her remix of the classic&nbsp;</span><span>Runaround Sue</span><span>&nbsp;and her next music video.&nbsp;Currently, he is said to be dating a woman simply named Halsey.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifXZquu8WMm6CoZZiatqi002auoqOZYrumwIydmK2hnpx6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6ywKagpbFf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jessica-blaylock-age-wiki-family-net-worth-birthday-height-measurements-bikini-feet.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jessica Blaylock Age, Wiki, Family, Net Worth, Birthday, Height, Measurements, Bikini, Feet</a>
