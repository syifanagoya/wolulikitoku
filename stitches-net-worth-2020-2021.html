Internet is the most powerful medium in today’s era of the tech-savvy audience and has a far wider reach than perhaps, even television. Much like various other artists who have used the power of the internet to showcase their talent, Stitches too grabbed eyeballs assertively rapping ‘Brick In Yo Face’ in 2014, which immediately went viral, bringing in a record 21 million views! He has never looked back ever since, adding a new feather to his hat almost every day.</p><p>Maybe you know about Stitches very well But do you know how old and tall is he, and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Stitches’ short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Born in the picturesque city of Miami, Florida, Stitches was named Phillip Nickolas Katsabanis at birth. It was only after he started performing and rapping that he first adopted the stage name of Lil Phil and later changed it to Stitches, thanks to the ‘Joker’ inspired stitched tattoo he sports around his mouth ever since he was 16.</p><p>Esther and Alexander Katsabanis already had two sons named Dimitri and Alexander when their third child, Stitches, was born. Shortly afterward, the couple split up, and the children were brought up by their mother, who supported the family working as a health insurance broker.</p><p>Growing up, Stitches was very inclined towards singing and dancing and often was at the center of his family gatherings. At about 14 years of age, he was dismissed from the G. Holmes Braddock Senior High School for allegedly assaulting the school’s Principal. He left his mother’s house after this incident and moved base to South Beach, Florida.</p><p>Barely 14 years of age, without proper education and with nobody to support him, Stitches resorted to selling drugs and guns to support himself. Although he has refused to talk about this, it is widely believed that this was his only income source up until his first mixtape ‘No Stitching Is My Statement’ came out in 2014.</p><p>A self-made man, Stitches now solely concentrates on his musical career although, he does rap a lot about his life experiences as a drug dealer. On the personal front, he settled into married life in 2012 and now is the proud father of 3 kids. He has a penchant for tattoos, and sort of has a drug problem that has resulted in many controversies for the rapper, including the arrest in January this year on charges of felony.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 17 June 1995, Stitches is 29 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.86 m. Tall, and weight is ‎86 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>For quite some time after his first rap video ‘Brick In Yo Face’ went viral, Stitches made waves mostly in the online space releasing several mixtapes, like ‘No Snitching Is My Statement’, ‘Brick Bible’ and ‘Supply and Demand’ to name a few that mostly included an exquisite confluence of many overlapping musical influences. Much of his music is available on iTunes from where it can be easily downloaded by his fans.</p><p>Eventually, in 2015, Stitches was signed by TMI Gang Entertainment and has since then released four studio albums titled ‘For Drug Dealers Only,’ ‘Tales of a Drug Lord,’ ‘Cocaine Holiday’ and ‘I Need Rehab’ that have considerably increased his popularity.</p><p>As of 2017, his fame in the online sphere knows no bounds with over 1.3 million followers on Instagram and about 340,000 subscribers on YouTube. He also performs at various stage shows across America.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Relatively new on the American rap scene, Stitches has no awards to his credit yet.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Stitches in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stitches-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The total estimated net worth of Stitches is about $500 thousand, a fortune that is bound to increase with his increasing fame.</p><p>Stitches is just starting out in the world of music and is already creating all the right waves; therefore, with the right hard work and determination, he is bound to achieve all the success in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZMC1tdOcn56rXaOytXnWqKmtoF1nfXN8jGtna2lf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./adam-bilzerian.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Dan Bilzerian's Brother, Adam Bilzerian Dating?
