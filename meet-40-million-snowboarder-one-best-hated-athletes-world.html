Unfortunately, he was unable to replicate his success in Sochi, a failing which all of his competitors openly cheered about. &nbsp;Shaun White's undeniable snowboarding skill, combined with his good looks and charm, have resulted in lucrative endorsement deals that have netted him a healthy <strong>net worth of 40 million dollars</strong>. &nbsp;To the general public, he is the poster-boy for winter sports. To other snowboarders, he is the man everyone loves to hate. &nbsp;So – how did a 20-something dude from California get so good? &nbsp;More importantly, why do some people hate him for it?</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-192735 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GettyImages-160486059.jpg alt="Shaun White " width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-192735 class=wp-caption-text>Shaun White Net Worth / Doug Pensinger/Getty Images</p><p><a href=#>Shaun White</a> was born in San Diego, California on September 3, 1986.&nbsp; He was drawn to anything related to a board from an early age, and began skateboarding and snowboarding at the same time.&nbsp; During the winter, he would snowboard on Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain in New England, and also hit the slopes in the San Bernardino Mountains in California.&nbsp; Exceptional from the beginning of his snowboarding days at age six, he'd earned his first sponsorship by age seven.&nbsp; During the summer and fall, he could be found on his skateboard, turning heads at all the local skateparks in southern California.&nbsp; By his early teens, it was clear that he was no ordinary skateboarder either.&nbsp; He was taken under the wing of famed skateboarder, <a href=# title="Tony Hawk Net Worth">Tony Hawk</a>, and turned pro when he was 17.&nbsp; He began winning major titles in both skateboarding and snowboarding in the early 2000s, and his success has continued unabated until this year's Olympics.&nbsp; In 2003, he became the first person to ever medal in two different sports while competing in both the Winter and Summer X Games.</p><p>While his skateboarding career is certainly impressive, (with two Golds, two Silvers, and a Bronze at the Summer X Games), it is his snowboarding career that has made him most famous.&nbsp; The sheer number of years he has dominated the sport has made him a household name for people who might otherwise have never paid attention to snowboarding.&nbsp; His interesting looks and easy California charm have made him a favorite with talk show hosts and sports commentators, and he has become the poster child for the X Games and winter sports, in general.&nbsp; It has also made him easy to dislike.&nbsp; Like the kid who always has the right answer in class at school, Shaun White's dominance of the sport has not enamored him to his fellow competitors.&nbsp; As one snowboarder said after Shaun's fourth place finish at the 2014 Olympics, "The world now knows that there are other snowboarders besides Shaun."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-192737 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GettyImages-467796057.jpg alt="Shaun White" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-192737 class=wp-caption-text>Shaun White / Al Bello/Getty Images</p><p>His run of awards and medals is approaching ridiculous, and of late, there has been some controversy as to whether he deserved some of them.&nbsp; Even his fourth place finish at Sochi has been quietly grumbled about among other competitors.&nbsp; There is the feeling among his competition, that at this point, the judges are simply in the habit of giving him a medal.&nbsp; Over the years, he has won two Gold Medals in the Halfpipe competition at the Winter Olympics.&nbsp; He has won a medal at every Winter X Games since 2002.&nbsp; At the moment, his X Games medal count is 13 Gold medals, three silver, and two bronze, made up of a combination of Superpipe and Slopestyle wins.&nbsp; He's also won multiple Open Championships.</p><p>In a sign that he has had an impact far beyond the snowboarding community, his video game, "Shaun White: Snowboarding" was the 20th best-selling video game in the United States in 2008.&nbsp; He became the first athlete to ever win Gold medals four years in a row at the Winter X Games with his fourth consecutive Gold in 2006, and he is the only athlete to have won both a Summer and Winter Dew Cup.&nbsp; He is the first athlete to land a number of jumps, in both snowboarding and skateboarding, and he is known for improving on jumps that other skateboarders and snowboarders pioneer.&nbsp; He also has multiple lucrative endorsement deals, and his rock band, Bad Things, opened at Lalapalooza last year and just released their first album.&nbsp; So… yeah… the man might as well have a bulls' eye on his chest.</p><p>After pulling out of the Slopestyle competition at the 2014 Olympics, citing concern about the track, all of his medal hopes were pinned on the Halfpipe.&nbsp; It made sense.&nbsp; He'd dominated the competition so long, it was sort of a no-brainer that he'd do the same at Sochi.&nbsp; However, another snowboarder, known as I-Pod by the snowboarding community, landed a jump that only a few snowboarders can pull off.&nbsp; The Yolo (You Only Live Once) requires 1,440 degrees of rotation and two aerial somersaults.&nbsp; Shaun White is one of the only other athletes who can complete it.&nbsp; I-Pod, a.k.a. Iouri Podlatdtchikov – nailed it.&nbsp; Shaun White – not so much.&nbsp; With that disappointing run, Shaun's reign atop the podium ended.&nbsp; What it will mean for the rest of the snowboarding world remains to be seen.&nbsp; Will the man who has been at the head of the class move back to the front at the next major competition, or is this a sign that he is finally slowing down?&nbsp; Ask any other snowboarder out there, and all of them are hoping the answer is the latter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJopJ6dpGKBcXnMoqOloZ%2BjerS6zrCZqJmimbKzec6nnGaalajBbrTArZydZZGpta2x056qZq%2Bfp7mlew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-john-franklin-iii-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is John Franklin III Dating Now</a>
